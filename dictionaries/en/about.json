My name is Alexey, and I am a front-end developer with over two years of experience creating modern single-page applications (SPA) and hybrid applications on Next.js (SSR/SSG/SPA) using Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, native JavaScript (ES6+), and modern UI frameworks (Material UI, Ant Design, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, Styled Components).",
    "My main priority is to write efficient, clean, and maintainable code, following modern best practices and scalable development principles. I strive to create high-quality, intuitive, and accessible user interfaces that are easy to develop and maintain in the long term.",
    "I am constantly improving my professional skills, learning new technologies and tools, including modern graphic libraries and approaches to interface animation.",
    "I value honest and constructive feedback, and I am comfortable working both independently and as part of a team. I am open to various formats of cooperation (remote, hybrid, part-time, or full-time).",
    "In addition to frontend development, I have basic knowledge of CI/CD and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and I am interested in backend development and actively studying DevOps approaches to be as useful as possible in complex projects.",
